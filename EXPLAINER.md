# AgentOps Replay - AI Agent Testing Platform

## The AI Agent Reliability Crisis

**Organizations are deploying AI agents without understanding their behavior.**

### The Real-World Problem

You've built an AI agent to analyze financial reports. It works great in testing. But in production:

- **Monday**: Tesla 10K → GPT-3.5 (temp=0) → EBITDA: $8.544B ✅ Accurate
- **Tuesday**: Same Tesla 10K → GPT-4o-mini (temp=1) → EBITDA: $50K ❌ Wrong by 99%
- **Wednesday**: Same Tesla 10K → GPT-5-mini → EBITDA: $50B ❌ Wrong by 500%

**All three sessions return HTTP 200 "success" - but only one is correct.**

Your agent produces wildly different results based on:
- Which model it randomly selects
- Temperature settings you forgot about
- Fallback behavior you didn't test
- Non-deterministic responses you can't predict

**Without proper testing, you don't know which one your customers are getting.**

## What AgentOps Replay Does

### **Agent Testing Platform**
Test your AI agents across multiple models simultaneously:
- **Agent Category**: Finance & Accounting (expandable)
- **Agent Objective**: Extract KPIs from 10K reports
- **Data Sources**: Tesla, Microsoft, Apple 10K reports
- **Multi-Model Testing**: GPT-5-mini, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo

### **Cross-Model Validation**
Instantly see how models compare on the same task:
- **Agreement Scoring**: 100% = models agree, <70% = significant disagreement
- **Variance Detection**: Flags >10% differences in outputs
- **Cost Comparison**: $0.09m (GPT-4o-mini) vs $1.00m (GPT-5-mini)
- **Performance Rating**: 1-5 stars based on speed, cost, accuracy, reproducibility

### **Production Monitoring**
Monitor your deployed agents:
- **Live Metrics**: Accuracy (99.2%), uptime (99.8%), cost per request
- **Alert System**: Performance degradation, unusual patterns
- **Complete Observability**: Every LLM call logged with full context
- **Deterministic Replay**: Reproduce any session exactly for debugging

## Why This Matters

### The Hidden Costs
- **Model Selection**: GPT-5 costs 10x more than GPT-3.5 for the same task
- **Temperature Settings**: temp>0 creates non-deterministic behavior (compliance risk)
- **Hallucination Errors**: AI confidently returns wrong calculations worth billions
- **Variance Blindness**: Same input produces different outputs without warning

### Industry Impact

**Financial Services**: Wrong EBITDA calculations → Bad investment decisions → Millions lost

**Healthcare**: Inconsistent diagnoses → Patient safety issues → Regulatory violations

**Legal**: Different contract interpretations → Compliance failures → Lawsuits

**Enterprise**: Non-deterministic agents → Failed audits → Business disruption

## Our Technical Innovation

### **Agent-First Architecture**
```
Agent Definition → Real Data Sources → Multi-Model Testing
       ↓                ↓                    ↓
Cross-Model Validation ← Event Logger ← Model Responses
       ↓                ↓                    ↓
Production Monitoring ← Dashboard ← Deterministic Replay
```

### **Complete Observability**
Every agent interaction is captured:
- **Event Sourcing**: Parse → LLM Call → Validation → Output
- **Full Context**: Prompts, responses, tokens, costs, latency
- **Validation Results**: Domain-specific correctness checking
- **Replay Capability**: Exact reproduction for investigation

### **Real Multi-Model Testing**
Unlike generic LLM monitoring, we test agents across models:
- **Parallel Execution**: Run 4 models simultaneously on same data
- **Real API Calls**: Actual GPT-5, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 calls with real costs
- **Live Comparison**: Immediate visibility into model differences
- **Production Simulation**: Test variance before deployment

## Demo Experience: Tesla 10K Analysis

### **Step 1: Select Data Source**
Choose Tesla 10K 2024 → Triggers multi-model analysis

### **Step 2: See Real Results**
- **GPT-3.5-turbo (T=0)**: Revenue $96.8B, EBITDA $8.5B, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, $0.47m
- **GPT-4o-mini (T=1)**: Revenue $125K, EBITDA $50K, ⭐⭐⭐, $0.09m (99% error!)
- **GPT-5-mini (T=0)**: Revenue $125M, EBITDA $50M, ⭐⭐⭐⭐, $1.00m (fallback data)
- **GPT-3.5 (T=0.7)**: Revenue $96.8B, EBITDA $8.5B, ⭐⭐⭐, $0.47m (non-deterministic)

### **Step 3: Cross-Model Validation Alert**
- **Agreement Score**: 25% (models disagree significantly!)
- **Variance Flags**: Revenue variance 99,975%, EBITDA variance 99,994%
- **Temperature Warnings**: 2 models using temp>0 (hallucination risk)
- **Recommendation**: Use GPT-3.5-turbo temp=0 for optimal cost/accuracy

### **Step 4: Production Insights**
- **Cost Optimization**: GPT-4o-mini is 10x cheaper but produces wrong results
- **Accuracy Validation**: Only GPT-3.5 temp=0 gets correct calculations
- **Compliance Ready**: Temperature=0 ensures deterministic, auditable results

## The Business Impact

### **Immediate Value**
1. **Catch Errors Before Customers Do**: Find calculation mistakes worth millions
2. **Optimize Costs**: Stop overpaying for models that don't improve accuracy
3. **Ensure Compliance**: Identify non-deterministic behavior before audit
4. **Validate Performance**: Test agents thoroughly before production deployment

### **Enterprise Scale Impact**
For 1M agent calls per month:
- **GPT-3.5 optimized**: $12,000/year, reliable results
- **Random model selection**: $45,000/year, inconsistent quality
- **Hidden waste**: $33,000 in unnecessary costs + compliance risk

## Why Judges Should Care

## The Future of AI Reliability

**AgentOps Replay represents the next evolution of software reliability.**

Just as we learned to monitor web applications, databases, and microservices - we now need to monitor AI agents. The stakes are higher: AI agents make decisions, spend money, and interact with customers.

**This platform provides the foundation for reliable AI in production.**
