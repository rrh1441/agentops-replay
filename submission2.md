# ClearFrame - AI Agent Observability Platform

## Title
**ClearFrame**

## Short Description
ClearFrame is a real-time observability platform that provides crystal-clear visibility into AI agent workflows—from model selection to final output—ensuring reliable, cost-effective agent deployments in production.

---

## Problem & Challenge
AI agents in production are black boxes. When they fail, hallucinate, or blow through budgets, teams have no visibility into what went wrong. Current monitoring tools show you metrics but not the actual decision chain. Teams are flying blind with:
- **Cost explosions**: GPT-4o costs 16x more than GPT-4o Mini, but teams don't know until the bill arrives
- **Silent failures**: Agents hallucinate or produce inconsistent results without detection
- **Debugging nightmares**: No way to replay exactly what happened during a failure
- **Model sprawl**: New models launch weekly (GPT-4.1, Claude, Gemini) with no systematic way to compare them

---

## Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- **AI/ML Engineers** building and deploying agent systems
- **DevOps Teams** responsible for production reliability and cost management
- **Engineering Managers** tracking AI spend and performance
- **Financial Services** requiring deterministic, auditable AI decisions

**Specific Use Cases:**
- Companies running customer-facing AI agents that need 99.9% reliability
- Teams migrating between models (GPT-4 → GPT-4o Mini) to reduce costs
- Regulated industries needing compliance and audit trails
- Startups optimizing AI costs before they scale

## Solution and Core Features

### How We Solve It
ClearFrame brings transparency to the black box of AI agents. We intercept every API call, transformation, and decision in your agent workflow, providing clear visibility into what's happening at each step. Every interaction is logged, visualized, and made replayable.

### Core Features
1. **Multi-Model Testing Ground**
   - Test 5+ models simultaneously on the same data
   - Side-by-side cost/performance comparison
   - Real financial data testing (Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon 10Ks)

2. **Cross-Model Validation**
   - Automatic detection when models disagree (12% EBITDA variance caught)
   - Statistical variance analysis prevents hallucinations
   - Temperature monitoring for determinism

3. **Complete Event Timeline**
   - Every API call logged with input/output/tokens/latency
   - Parent-child event relationships
   - One-click session replay

4. **Real-Time Cost Tracking**
   - Accurate per-million-token pricing
   - Cost comparison across models ($150 vs $2,500 per million)
   - Budget alerts before overruns

5. **Compliance Scoring**
   - Determinism checks (temperature=0)
   - PII detection
   - Token limit validation
   - 100% score = production ready

## Unique Selling Proposition

### What Makes ClearFrame Different

**vs. LangSmith (LangChain's tool):**
- **Multi-model comparison**: LangSmith is single-chain focused; we compare 5 models simultaneously
- **Cost-first approach**: Real-time cost per million tokens vs. just trace logging
- **No framework lock-in**: Works with any HTTP API, not just LangChain

**vs. Datadog LLM Observability:**
- **Purpose-built for AI agents**: Not a bolt-on to existing APM
- **Replay capability**: Deterministic replay of entire sessions
- **10x faster setup**: Deploy in minutes, not days of configuration

**vs. Weights & Biases/MLflow:**
- **Production focus**: Built for live agents, not experiments
- **Business metrics**: Cost and compliance, not just accuracy
- **Non-technical stakeholder friendly**: Managers can understand costs instantly

**Key Differentiator**: We're the only platform that treats AI agents like financial transactions—every token counted, every decision auditable, every path replayable.

   Intercept LLM calls    Store in Supabase    Deterministic replay
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime), Edge Functions
- **Logging**: Event-sourcing with JSONL format
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini)
- **Deployment**: Vercel Edge Network, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Custom telemetry with parent-child event tracking

### Key Technical Innovations
1. **Parallel Model Testing**: Promise.all() for 5x faster comparisons
2. **Statistical Variance Detection**: Standard deviation analysis across model outputs
3. **Deterministic Replay**: Temperature=0 enforcement + complete prompt storage
4. **Real-time Cost Calculation**: Token counting with model-specific pricing

## Results and Impact

### Achieved in 24 Hours
- **5 models integrated** with accurate pricing (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, variants)
- **~2 second response time** for parallel multi-model analysis
- **100% cost accuracy** matching OpenAI billing
- **12% variance detected** in cross-model EBITDA calculations
- **16x cost savings identified** (GPT-4o Mini vs GPT-4o)
- **3 major companies' data tested** (Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon 10Ks)

### Business Impact
- **Cost Reduction**: Teams save 80%+ by identifying cheaper models with similar accuracy
- **Risk Mitigation**: Catch hallucinations before production with variance detection
- **Faster Debugging**: 10x faster root cause analysis with event timelines
- **Compliance Ready**: Automatic audit trails for regulated industries
- **Model Migration**: Safely test new models before switching

### Validation
Successfully demonstrated that GPT-4o Mini ($150/M tokens) produces equivalent financial KPI extraction to GPT-4o ($2,500/M tokens) on real 10K reports—a 94% cost reduction with maintained accuracy.

## Additional Info

### Why "ClearFrame"?
We provide a clear frame of reference for understanding AI agent behavior. Like a film frame that captures a moment in time, ClearFrame captures every moment of your agent's execution, allowing you to see the complete picture of what happened, when, and why.

### Production Ready
- Deployed live at [clearframe.vercel.app](https://clearframe.vercel.app)
- Real-time Supabase backend handling concurrent sessions
- Edge deployment for <50ms latency globally

### Future Vision
With 24 more hours, we'd add:
- Streaming responses for real-time agent monitoring
- Custom alert rules ("notify if cost > $10/hour")
- Integration with LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI
- Historical trend analysis and anomaly detection

### Open Source Commitment
Planning to open-source core components to help the community build more observable AI systems.
